1. callback fuctions are functions which are paased in the arguments of the other function.
    callbacks are used to handle the async tasks in the js.foreach and map method of array are
    exampleof the sync callbacks. and web apis and setimout ofbrowser are async tasks.

2. No it is not necssariy that the callbacks are the only used in the async tasks rather it is 
used in sync taskalso in daily uses if we want the any function to return the value after the completion
of the other function .or we use .mapmethod the array orin loop we use for each loop.

3. when we pass a callback in argument is will execute after the parent function comleted its execution then 
new exection context of the function will be created for the paaased function and then it will execute and poped off from
the call stack . 
               





4 console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("C"));

console.log("D");

 ans - >  A , d , c, b  

 due to the sync behavor a and b willprint  first then the Promise willbe 
 reslved because it resides n the micro task and the priority of the micro task
 is higher thant the macrotask and timer function will be in macrotask.
