## 🚀 Interview Question 1: Class and Object

**Interviewer:** A core concept in OOP is the distinction between a **Class** and an **Object**. Can you write a simple Python class to represent a $\mathbf{Car}$ and then create a few specific car objects?

After writing the code, please explain:

1.  What is the **Class** in your code?
2.  What are the **Objects**?
3.  What role does the `__init__` method play?

Take your time and present your code first, followed by your explanations.
